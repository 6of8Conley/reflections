I've used programs like this before I wasn't aware of the command line options diff and FC, pretty useful to know. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would take less time to walk back from a mistake. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The saved files will be more logical and easier to search.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It makes more sense when files are interdependent.
